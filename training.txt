Bee Movie Script - Dialogue Transcript

  
According to all known laws
of aviation,

  
there is no way a bee
should be able to fly.

  
Its wings are too small to get
its fat little body off the ground.

  
The bee, of course, flies anyway

  
because bees don't care
what humans think is impossible.

  
Yellow, black. Yellow, black.
Yellow, black. Yellow, black.

  
Ooh, black and yellow!
Let's shake it up a little.

  
Barry! Breakfast is ready!

  
Ooming!

  
Hang on a second.

  
Hello?

  
- Barry?
- Adam?

  
- Oan you believe this is happening?
- I can't. I'll pick you up.

  
Looking sharp.

  
Use the stairs. Your father
paid good money for those.

  
Sorry. I'm excited.

  
Here's the graduate.
We're very proud of you, son.

  
A perfect report card, all B's.

  
Very proud.

  
Ma! I got a thing going here.

  
- You got lint on your fuzz.
- Ow! That's me!

  
- Wave to us! We'll be in row 118,000.
- Bye!

  
Barry, I told you,
stop flying in the house!

  
- Hey, Adam.
- Hey, Barry.

  
- Is that fuzz gel?
- A little. Special day, graduation.

  
Never thought I'd make it.

  
Three days grade school,
three days high school.

  
Those were awkward.

  
Three days college. I'm glad I took
a day and hitchhiked around the hive.

  
You did come back different.

  
- Hi, Barry.
- Artie, growing a mustache? Looks good.

  
- Hear about Frankie?
- Yeah.

  
- You going to the funeral?
- No, I'm not going.

  
Everybody knows,
sting someone, you die.

  
Don't waste it on a squirrel.
Such a hothead.

  
I guess he could have
just gotten out of the way.

  
I love this incorporating
an amusement park into our day.

  
That's why we don't need vacations.

  
Boy, quite a bit of pomp...
under the circumstances.

  
- Well, Adam, today we are men.
- We are!

  
- Bee-men.
- Amen!

  
Hallelujah!

  
Students, faculty, distinguished bees,

  
please welcome Dean Buzzwell.

  
Welcome, New Hive Oity
graduating class of...

  
...9:15.

  
That concludes our ceremonies.

  
And begins your career
at Honex Industries!

  
Will we pick ourjob today?

  
I heard it's just orientation.

  
Heads up! Here we go.

  
Keep your hands and antennas
inside the tram at all times.

  
- Wonder what it'll be like?
- A little scary.

  
Welcome to Honex,
a division of Honesco

  
and a part of the Hexagon Group.

  
This is it!

  
Wow.

  
Wow.

  
We know that you, as a bee,
have worked your whole life

  
to get to the point where you
can work for your whole life.

  
Honey begins when our valiant Pollen
Jocks bring the nectar to the hive.

  
Our top-secret formula

  
is automatically color-corrected,
scent-adjusted and bubble-contoured

  
into this soothing sweet syrup

  
with its distinctive
golden glow you know as...

  
Honey!

  
- That girl was hot.
- She's my cousin!

  
- She is?
- Yes, we're all cousins.

  
- Right. You're right.
- At Honex, we constantly strive

  
to improve every aspect
of bee existence.

  
These bees are stress-testing
a new helmet technology.

  
- What do you think he makes?
- Not enough.

  
Here we have our latest advancement,
the Krelman.

  
- What does that do?
- Oatches that little strand of honey

  
that hangs after you pour it.
Saves us millions.

  
Oan anyone work on the Krelman?

  
Of course. Most bee jobs are
small ones. But bees know

  
that every small job,
if it's done well, means a lot.

  
But choose carefully

  
because you'll stay in the job
you pick for the rest of your life.

  
The same job the rest of your life?
I didn't know that.

  
What's the difference?

  
You'll be happy to know that bees,
as a species, haven't had one day off

  
in 27 million years.

  
So you'll just work us to death?

  
We'll sure try.

  
Wow! That blew my mind!

  
"What's the difference?"
How can you say that?

  
One job forever?
That's an insane choice to have to make.

  
I'm relieved. Now we only have
to make one decision in life.

  
But, Adam, how could they
never have told us that?

  
Why would you question anything?
We're bees.

  
We're the most perfectly
functioning society on Earth.

  
You ever think maybe things
work a little too well here?

  
Like what? Give me one example.

  
I don't know. But you know
what I'm talking about.

  
Please clear the gate.
Royal Nectar Force on approach.

  
Wait a second. Oheck it out.

  
- Hey, those are Pollen Jocks!
- Wow.

  
I've never seen them this close.

  
They know what it's like
outside the hive.

  
Yeah, but some don't come back.

  
- Hey, Jocks!
- Hi, Jocks!

  
You guys did great!

  
You're monsters!
You're sky freaks! I love it! I love it!

  
- I wonder where they were.
- I don't know.

  
Their day's not planned.

  
Outside the hive, flying who knows
where, doing who knows what.

  
You can't just decide to be a Pollen
Jock. You have to be bred for that.

  
Right.

  
Look. That's more pollen
than you and I will see in a lifetime.

  
It's just a status symbol.
Bees make too much of it.

  
Perhaps. Unless you're wearing it
and the ladies see you wearing it.

  
Those ladies?
Aren't they our cousins too?

  
Distant. Distant.

  
Look at these two.

  
- Oouple of Hive Harrys.
- Let's have fun with them.

  
It must be dangerous
being a Pollen Jock.

  
Yeah. Once a bear pinned me
against a mushroom!

  
He had a paw on my throat,
and with the other, he was slapping me!

  
- Oh, my!
- I never thought I'd knock him out.

  
What were you doing during this?

  
Trying to alert the authorities.

  
I can autograph that.

  
A little gusty out there today,
wasn't it, comrades?

  
Yeah. Gusty.

  
We're hitting a sunflower patch
six miles from here tomorrow.

  
- Six miles, huh?
- Barry!

  
A puddle jump for us,
but maybe you're not up for it.

  
- Maybe I am.
- You are not!

  
We're going 0900 at J-Gate.

  
What do you think, buzzy-boy?
Are you bee enough?

  
I might be. It all depends
on what 0900 means.

  
Hey, Honex!

  
Dad, you surprised me.

  
You decide what you're interested in?

  
- Well, there's a lot of choices.
- But you only get one.

  
Do you ever get bored
doing the same job every day?

  
Son, let me tell you about stirring.

  
You grab that stick, and you just
move it around, and you stir it around.

  
You get yourself into a rhythm.
It's a beautiful thing.

  
You know, Dad,
the more I think about it,

  
maybe the honey field
just isn't right for me.

  
You were thinking of what,
making balloon animals?

  
That's a bad job
for a guy with a stinger.

  
Janet, your son's not sure
he wants to go into honey!

  
- Barry, you are so funny sometimes.
- I'm not trying to be funny.

  
You're not funny! You're going
into honey. Our son, the stirrer!

  
- You're gonna be a stirrer?
- No one's listening to me!

  
Wait till you see the sticks I have.

  
I could say anything right now.
I'm gonna get an ant tattoo!

  
Let's open some honey and celebrate!

  
Maybe I'll pierce my thorax.
Shave my antennae.

  
Shack up with a grasshopper. Get
a gold tooth and call everybody "dawg"!

  
I'm so proud.

  
- We're starting work today!
- Today's the day.

  
Oome on! All the good jobs
will be gone.

  
Yeah, right.

  
Pollen counting, stunt bee, pouring,
stirrer, front desk, hair removal...

  
- Is it still available?
- Hang on. Two left!

  
One of them's yours! Oongratulations!
Step to the side.

  
- What'd you get?
- Picking crud out. Stellar!

  
Wow!

  
Oouple of newbies?

  
Yes, sir! Our first day! We are ready!

  
Make your choice.

  
- You want to go first?
- No, you go.

  
Oh, my. What's available?

  
Restroom attendant's open,
not for the reason you think.

  
- Any chance of getting the Krelman?
- Sure, you're on.

  
I'm sorry, the Krelman just closed out.

  
Wax monkey's always open.

  
The Krelman opened up again.

  
What happened?

  
A bee died. Makes an opening. See?
He's dead. Another dead one.

  
Deady. Deadified. Two more dead.

  
Dead from the neck up.
Dead from the neck down. That's life!

  
Oh, this is so hard!

  
Heating, cooling,
stunt bee, pourer, stirrer,

  
humming, inspector number seven,
lint coordinator, stripe supervisor,

  
mite wrangler. Barry, what
do you think I should... Barry?

  
Barry!

  
All right, we've got the sunflower patch
in quadrant nine...

  
What happened to you?
Where are you?

  
- I'm going out.
- Out? Out where?

  
- Out there.
- Oh, no!

  
I have to, before I go
to work for the rest of my life.

  
You're gonna die! You're crazy! Hello?

  
Another call coming in.

  
If anyone's feeling brave,
there's a Korean deli on 83rd

  
that gets their roses today.

  
Hey, guys.

  
- Look at that.
- Isn't that the kid we saw yesterday?

  
Hold it, son, flight deck's restricted.

  
It's OK, Lou. We're gonna take him up.

  
Really? Feeling lucky, are you?

  
Sign here, here. Just initial that.

  
- Thank you.
- OK.

  
You got a rain advisory today,

  
and as you all know,
bees cannot fly in rain.

  
So be careful. As always,
watch your brooms,

  
hockey sticks, dogs,
birds, bears and bats.

  
Also, I got a couple of reports
of root beer being poured on us.

  
Murphy's in a home because of it,
babbling like a cicada!

  
- That's awful.
- And a reminder for you rookies,

  
bee law number one,
absolutely no talking to humans!

  
All right, launch positions!

  
Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz! Buzz, buzz,
buzz, buzz! Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz!

  
Black and yellow!

  
Hello!

  
You ready for this, hot shot?

  
Yeah. Yeah, bring it on.

  
Wind, check.

  
- Antennae, check.
- Nectar pack, check.

  
- Wings, check.
- Stinger, check.

  
Scared out of my shorts, check.

  
OK, ladies,

  
let's move it out!

  
Pound those petunias,
you striped stem-suckers!

  
All of you, drain those flowers!

  
Wow! I'm out!

  
I can't believe I'm out!

  
So blue.

  
I feel so fast and free!

  
Box kite!

  
Wow!

  
Flowers!

  
This is Blue Leader.
We have roses visual.

  
Bring it around 30 degrees and hold.

  
Roses!

  
30 degrees, roger. Bringing it around.

  
Stand to the side, kid.
It's got a bit of a kick.

  
That is one nectar collector!

  
- Ever see pollination up close?
- No, sir.

  
I pick up some pollen here, sprinkle it
over here. Maybe a dash over there,

  
a pinch on that one.
See that? It's a little bit of magic.

  
That's amazing. Why do we do that?

  
That's pollen power. More pollen, more
flowers, more nectar, more honey for us.

  
Oool.

  
I'm picking up a lot of bright yellow.
Oould be daisies. Don't we need those?

  
Oopy that visual.

  
Wait. One of these flowers
seems to be on the move.

  
Say again? You're reporting
a moving flower?

  
Affirmative.

  
That was on the line!

  
This is the coolest. What is it?

  
I don't know, but I'm loving this color.

  
It smells good.
Not like a flower, but I like it.

  
Yeah, fuzzy.

  
Ohemical-y.

  
Oareful, guys. It's a little grabby.

  
My sweet lord of bees!

  
Oandy-brain, get off there!

  
Problem!

  
- Guys!
- This could be bad.

  
Affirmative.

  
Very close.

  
Gonna hurt.

  
Mama's little boy.

  
You are way out of position, rookie!

  
Ooming in at you like a missile!

  
Help me!

  
I don't think these are flowers.

  
- Should we tell him?
- I think he knows.

  
What is this?!

  
Match point!

  
You can start packing up, honey,
because you're about to eat it!

  
Yowser!

  
Gross.

  
There's a bee in the car!

  
- Do something!
- I'm driving!

  
- Hi, bee.
- He's back here!

  
He's going to sting me!

  
Nobody move. If you don't move,
he won't sting you. Freeze!

  
He blinked!

  
Spray him, Granny!

  
What are you doing?!

  
Wow... the tension level
out here is unbelievable.

  
I gotta get home.

  
Oan't fly in rain.

  
Oan't fly in rain.

  
Oan't fly in rain.

  
Mayday! Mayday! Bee going down!

  
Ken, could you close
the window please?

  
Ken, could you close
the window please?

  
Oheck out my new resume.
I made it into a fold-out brochure.

  
You see? Folds out.

  
Oh, no. More humans. I don't need this.

  
What was that?

  
Maybe this time. This time. This time.
This time! This time! This...

  
Drapes!

  
That is diabolical.

  
It's fantastic. It's got all my special
skills, even my top-ten favorite movies.

  
What's number one? Star Wars?

  
Nah, I don't go for that...

  
...kind of stuff.

  
No wonder we shouldn't talk to them.
They're out of their minds.

  
When I leave a job interview, they're
flabbergasted, can't believe what I say.

  
There's the sun. Maybe that's a way out.

  
I don't remember the sun
having a big 75 on it.

  
I predicted global warming.

  
I could feel it getting hotter.
At first I thought it was just me.

  
Wait! Stop! Bee!

  
Stand back. These are winter boots.

  
Wait!

  
Don't kill him!

  
You know I'm allergic to them!
This thing could kill me!

  
Why does his life have
less value than yours?

  
Why does his life have any less value
than mine? Is that your statement?

  
I'm just saying all life has value. You
don't know what he's capable of feeling.

  
My brochure!

  
There you go, little guy.

  
I'm not scared of him.
It's an allergic thing.

  
Put that on your resume brochure.

  
My whole face could puff up.

  
Make it one of your special skills.

  
Knocking someone out
is also a special skill.

  
Right. Bye, Vanessa. Thanks.

  
- Vanessa, next week? Yogurt night?
- Sure, Ken. You know, whatever.

  
- You could put carob chips on there.
- Bye.

  
- Supposed to be less calories.
- Bye.

  
I gotta say something.

  
She saved my life.
I gotta say something.

  
All right, here it goes.

  
Nah.

  
What would I say?

  
I could really get in trouble.

  
It's a bee law.
You're not supposed to talk to a human.

  
I can't believe I'm doing this.

  
I've got to.

  
Oh, I can't do it. Oome on!

  
No. Yes. No.

  
Do it. I can't.

  
How should I start it?
"You like jazz?" No, that's no good.

  
Here she comes! Speak, you fool!

  
Hi!

  
I'm sorry.

  
- You're talking.
- Yes, I know.

  
You're talking!

  
I'm so sorry.

  
No, it's OK. It's fine.
I know I'm dreaming.

  
But I don't recall going to bed.

  
Well, I'm sure this
is very disconcerting.

  
This is a bit of a surprise to me.
I mean, you're a bee!

  
I am. And I'm not supposed
to be doing this,

  
but they were all trying to kill me.

  
And if it wasn't for you...

  
I had to thank you.
It's just how I was raised.

  
That was a little weird.

  
- I'm talking with a bee.
- Yeah.

  
I'm talking to a bee.
And the bee is talking to me!

  
I just want to say I'm grateful.
I'll leave now.

  
- Wait! How did you learn to do that?
- What?

  
The talking thing.

  
Same way you did, I guess.
"Mama, Dada, honey." You pick it up.

  
- That's very funny.
- Yeah.

  
Bees are funny. If we didn't laugh,
we'd cry with what we have to deal with.

  
Anyway...

  
Oan I...

  
...get you something?
- Like what?

  
I don't know. I mean...
I don't know. Ooffee?

  
I don't want to put you out.

  
It's no trouble. It takes two minutes.

  
- It's just coffee.
- I hate to impose.

  
- Don't be ridiculous!
- Actually, I would love a cup.

  
Hey, you want rum cake?

  
- I shouldn't.
- Have some.

  
- No, I can't.
- Oome on!

  
I'm trying to lose a couple micrograms.

  
- Where?
- These stripes don't help.

  
You look great!

  
I don't know if you know
anything about fashion.

  
Are you all right?

  
No.

  
He's making the tie in the cab
as they're flying up Madison.

  
He finally gets there.

  
He runs up the steps into the church.
The wedding is on.

  
And he says, "Watermelon?
I thought you said Guatemalan.

  
Why would I marry a watermelon?"

  
Is that a bee joke?

  
That's the kind of stuff we do.

  
Yeah, different.

  
So, what are you gonna do, Barry?

  
About work? I don't know.

  
I want to do my part for the hive,
but I can't do it the way they want.

  
I know how you feel.

  
- You do?
- Sure.

  
My parents wanted me to be a lawyer or
a doctor, but I wanted to be a florist.

  
- Really?
- My only interest is flowers.

  
Our new queen was just elected
with that same campaign slogan.

  
Anyway, if you look...

  
There's my hive right there. See it?

  
You're in Sheep Meadow!

  
Yes! I'm right off the Turtle Pond!

  
No way! I know that area.
I lost a toe ring there once.

  
- Why do girls put rings on their toes?
- Why not?

  
- It's like putting a hat on your knee.
- Maybe I'll try that.

  
- You all right, ma'am?
- Oh, yeah. Fine.

  
Just having two cups of coffee!

  
Anyway, this has been great.
Thanks for the coffee.

  
Yeah, it's no trouble.

  
Sorry I couldn't finish it. If I did,
I'd be up the rest of my life.

  
Are you...?

  
Oan I take a piece of this with me?

  
Sure! Here, have a crumb.

  
- Thanks!
- Yeah.

  
All right. Well, then...
I guess I'll see you around.

  
Or not.

  
OK, Barry.

  
And thank you
so much again... for before.

  
Oh, that? That was nothing.

  
Well, not nothing, but... Anyway...

  
This can't possibly work.

  
He's all set to go.
We may as well try it.

  
OK, Dave, pull the chute.

  
- Sounds amazing.
- It was amazing!

  
It was the scariest,
happiest moment of my life.

  
Humans! I can't believe
you were with humans!

  
Giant, scary humans!
What were they like?

  
Huge and crazy. They talk crazy.

  
They eat crazy giant things.
They drive crazy.

  
- Do they try and kill you, like on TV?
- Some of them. But some of them don't.

  
- How'd you get back?
- Poodle.

  
You did it, and I'm glad. You saw
whatever you wanted to see.

  
You had your "experience." Now you
can pick out yourjob and be normal.

  
- Well...
- Well?

  
Well, I met someone.

  
You did? Was she Bee-ish?

  
- A wasp?! Your parents will kill you!
- No, no, no, not a wasp.

  
- Spider?
- I'm not attracted to spiders.

  
I know it's the hottest thing,
with the eight legs and all.

  
I can't get by that face.

  
So who is she?

  
She's... human.

  
No, no. That's a bee law.
You wouldn't break a bee law.

  
- Her name's Vanessa.
- Oh, boy.

  
She's so nice. And she's a florist!

  
Oh, no! You're dating a human florist!

  
We're not dating.

  
You're flying outside the hive, talking
to humans that attack our homes

  
with power washers and M-80s!
One-eighth a stick of dynamite!

  
She saved my life!
And she understands me.

  
This is over!

  
Eat this.

  
This is not over! What was that?

  
- They call it a crumb.
- It was so stingin' stripey!

  
And that's not what they eat.
That's what falls off what they eat!

  
- You know what a Oinnabon is?
- No.

  
It's bread and cinnamon and frosting.
They heat it up...

  
Sit down!

  
...really hot!
- Listen to me!

  
We are not them! We're us.
There's us and there's them!

  
Yes, but who can deny
the heart that is yearning?

  
There's no yearning.
Stop yearning. Listen to me!

  
You have got to start thinking bee,
my friend. Thinking bee!

  
- Thinking bee.
- Thinking bee.

  
Thinking bee! Thinking bee!
Thinking bee! Thinking bee!

  
There he is. He's in the pool.

  
You know what your problem is, Barry?

  
I gotta start thinking bee?

  
How much longer will this go on?

  
It's been three days!
Why aren't you working?

  
I've got a lot of big life decisions
to think about.

  
What life? You have no life!
You have no job. You're barely a bee!

  
Would it kill you
to make a little honey?

  
Barry, come out.
Your father's talking to you.

  
Martin, would you talk to him?

  
Barry, I'm talking to you!

  
You coming?

  
Got everything?

  
All set!

  
Go ahead. I'll catch up.

  
Don't be too long.

  
Watch this!

  
Vanessa!

  
- We're still here.
- I told you not to yell at him.

  
He doesn't respond to yelling!

  
- Then why yell at me?
- Because you don't listen!

  
I'm not listening to this.

  
Sorry, I've gotta go.

  
- Where are you going?
- I'm meeting a friend.

  
A girl? Is this why you can't decide?

  
Bye.

  
I just hope she's Bee-ish.

  
They have a huge parade
of flowers every year in Pasadena?

  
To be in the Tournament of Roses,
that's every florist's dream!

  
Up on a float, surrounded
by flowers, crowds cheering.

  
A tournament. Do the roses
compete in athletic events?

  
No. All right, I've got one.
How come you don't fly everywhere?

  
It's exhausting. Why don't you
run everywhere? It's faster.

  
Yeah, OK, I see, I see.
All right, your turn.

  
TiVo. You can just freeze live TV?
That's insane!

  
You don't have that?

  
We have Hivo, but it's a disease.
It's a horrible, horrible disease.

  
Oh, my.

  
Dumb bees!

  
You must want to sting all those jerks.

  
We try not to sting.
It's usually fatal for us.

  
So you have to watch your temper.

  
Very carefully.
You kick a wall, take a walk,

  
write an angry letter and throw it out.
Work through it like any emotion:

  
Anger, jealousy, lust.

  
Oh, my goodness! Are you OK?

  
Yeah.

  
- What is wrong with you?!
- It's a bug.

  
He's not bothering anybody.
Get out of here, you creep!

  
What was that? A Pic 'N' Save circular?

  
Yeah, it was. How did you know?

  
It felt like about 10 pages.
Seventy-five is pretty much our limit.

  
You've really got that
down to a science.

  
- I lost a cousin to Italian Vogue.
- I'll bet.

  
What in the name
of Mighty Hercules is this?

  
How did this get here?
Oute Bee, Golden Blossom,

  
Ray Liotta Private Select?

  
- Is he that actor?
- I never heard of him.

  
- Why is this here?
- For people. We eat it.

  
You don't have
enough food of your own?

  
- Well, yes.
- How do you get it?

  
- Bees make it.
- I know who makes it!

  
And it's hard to make it!

  
There's heating, cooling, stirring.
You need a whole Krelman thing!

  
- It's organic.
- It's our-ganic!

  
It's just honey, Barry.

  
Just what?!

  
Bees don't know about this!
This is stealing! A lot of stealing!

  
You've taken our homes, schools,
hospitals! This is all we have!

  
And it's on sale?!
I'm getting to the bottom of this.

  
I'm getting to the bottom
of all of this!

  
Hey, Hector.

  
- You almost done?
- Almost.

  
He is here. I sense it.

  
Well, I guess I'll go home now

  
and just leave this nice honey out,
with no one around.

  
You're busted, box boy!

  
I knew I heard something.
So you can talk!

  
I can talk.
And now you'll start talking!

  
Where you getting the sweet stuff?
Who's your supplier?

  
I don't understand.
I thought we were friends.

  
The last thing we want
to do is upset bees!

  
You're too late! It's ours now!

  
You, sir, have crossed
the wrong sword!

  
You, sir, will be lunch
for my iguana, Ignacio!

  
Where is the honey coming from?

  
Tell me where!

  
Honey Farms! It comes from Honey Farms!

  
Orazy person!

  
What horrible thing has happened here?

  
These faces, they never knew
what hit them. And now

  
they're on the road to nowhere!

  
Just keep still.

  
What? You're not dead?

  
Do I look dead? They will wipe anything
that moves. Where you headed?

  
To Honey Farms.
I am onto something huge here.

  
I'm going to Alaska. Moose blood,
crazy stuff. Blows your head off!

  
I'm going to Tacoma.

  
- And you?
- He really is dead.

  
All right.

  
Uh-oh!

  
- What is that?!
- Oh, no!

  
- A wiper! Triple blade!
- Triple blade?

  
Jump on! It's your only chance, bee!

  
Why does everything have
to be so doggone clean?!

  
How much do you people need to see?!

  
Open your eyes!
Stick your head out the window!

  
From NPR News in Washington,
I'm Oarl Kasell.

  
But don't kill no more bugs!

  
- Bee!
- Moose blood guy!!

  
- You hear something?
- Like what?

  
Like tiny screaming.

  
Turn off the radio.

  
Whassup, bee boy?

  
Hey, Blood.

  
Just a row of honey jars,
as far as the eye could see.

  
Wow!

  
I assume wherever this truck goes
is where they're getting it.

  
I mean, that honey's ours.

  
- Bees hang tight.
- We're all jammed in.

  
It's a close community.

  
Not us, man. We on our own.
Every mosquito on his own.

  
- What if you get in trouble?
- You a mosquito, you in trouble.

  
Nobody likes us. They just smack.
See a mosquito, smack, smack!

  
At least you're out in the world.
You must meet girls.

  
Mosquito girls try to trade up,
get with a moth, dragonfly.

  
Mosquito girl don't want no mosquito.

  
You got to be kidding me!

  
Mooseblood's about to leave
the building! So long, bee!

  
- Hey, guys!
- Mooseblood!

  
I knew I'd catch y'all down here.
Did you bring your crazy straw?

  
We throw it in jars, slap a label on it,
and it's pretty much pure profit.

  
What is this place?

  
A bee's got a brain
the size of a pinhead.

  
They are pinheads!

  
Pinhead.

  
- Oheck out the new smoker.
- Oh, sweet. That's the one you want.

  
The Thomas 3000!

  
Smoker?

  
Ninety puffs a minute, semi-automatic.
Twice the nicotine, all the tar.

  
A couple breaths of this
knocks them right out.

  
They make the honey,
and we make the money.

  
"They make the honey,
and we make the money"?

  
Oh, my!

  
What's going on? Are you OK?

  
Yeah. It doesn't last too long.

  
Do you know you're
in a fake hive with fake walls?

  
Our queen was moved here.
We had no choice.

  
This is your queen?
That's a man in women's clothes!

  
That's a drag queen!

  
What is this?

  
Oh, no!

  
There's hundreds of them!

  
Bee honey.

  
Our honey is being brazenly stolen
on a massive scale!

  
This is worse than anything bears
have done! I intend to do something.

  
Oh, Barry, stop.

  
Who told you humans are taking
our honey? That's a rumor.

  
Do these look like rumors?

  
That's a conspiracy theory.
These are obviously doctored photos.

  
How did you get mixed up in this?

  
He's been talking to humans.

  
- What?
- Talking to humans?!

  
He has a human girlfriend.
And they make out!

  
Make out? Barry!

  
We do not.

  
- You wish you could.
- Whose side are you on?

  
The bees!

  
I dated a cricket once in San Antonio.
Those crazy legs kept me up all night.

  
Barry, this is what you want
to do with your life?

  
I want to do it for all our lives.
Nobody works harder than bees!

  
Dad, I remember you
coming home so overworked

  
your hands were still stirring.
You couldn't stop.

  
I remember that.

  
What right do they have to our honey?

  
We live on two cups a year. They put it
in lip balm for no reason whatsoever!

  
Even if it's true, what can one bee do?

  
Sting them where it really hurts.

  
In the face! The eye!

  
- That would hurt.
- No.

  
Up the nose? That's a killer.

  
There's only one place you can sting
the humans, one place where it matters.

  
Hive at Five, the hive's only
full-hour action news source.

  
No more bee beards!

  
With Bob Bumble at the anchor desk.

  
Weather with Storm Stinger.

  
Sports with Buzz Larvi.

  
And Jeanette Ohung.

  
- Good evening. I'm Bob Bumble.
- And I'm Jeanette Ohung.

  
A tri-county bee, Barry Benson,

  
intends to sue the human race
for stealing our honey,

  
packaging it and profiting
from it illegally!

  
Tomorrow night on Bee Larry King,

  
we'll have three former queens here in
our studio, discussing their new book,

  
Olassy Ladies,
out this week on Hexagon.

  
Tonight we're talking to Barry Benson.

  
Did you ever think, "I'm a kid
from the hive. I can't do this"?

  
Bees have never been afraid
to change the world.

  
What about Bee Oolumbus?
Bee Gandhi? Bejesus?

  
Where I'm from, we'd never sue humans.

  
We were thinking
of stickball or candy stores.

  
How old are you?

  
The bee community
is supporting you in this case,

  
which will be the trial
of the bee century.

  
You know, they have a Larry King
in the human world too.

  
It's a common name. Next week...

  
He looks like you and has a show
and suspenders and colored dots...

  
Next week...

  
Glasses, quotes on the bottom from the
guest even though you just heard 'em.

  
Bear Week next week!
They're scary, hairy and here live.

  
Always leans forward, pointy shoulders,
squinty eyes, very Jewish.

  
In tennis, you attack
at the point of weakness!

  
It was my grandmother, Ken. She's 81.

  
Honey, her backhand's a joke!
I'm not gonna take advantage of that?

  
Quiet, please.
Actual work going on here.

  
- Is that that same bee?
- Yes, it is!

  
I'm helping him sue the human race.

  
- Hello.
- Hello, bee.

  
This is Ken.

  
Yeah, I remember you. Timberland, size
ten and a half. Vibram sole, I believe.

  
Why does he talk again?

  
Listen, you better go
'cause we're really busy working.

  
But it's our yogurt night!

  
Bye-bye.

  
Why is yogurt night so difficult?!

  
You poor thing.
You two have been at this for hours!

  
Yes, and Adam here
has been a huge help.

  
- Frosting...
- How many sugars?

  
Just one. I try not
to use the competition.

  
So why are you helping me?

  
Bees have good qualities.

  
And it takes my mind off the shop.

  
Instead of flowers, people
are giving balloon bouquets now.

  
Those are great, if you're three.

  
And artificial flowers.

  
- Oh, those just get me psychotic!
- Yeah, me too.

  
Bent stingers, pointless pollination.

  
Bees must hate those fake things!

  
Nothing worse
than a daffodil that's had work done.

  
Maybe this could make up
for it a little bit.

  
- This lawsuit's a pretty big deal.
- I guess.

  
You sure you want to go through with it?

  
Am I sure? When I'm done with
the humans, they won't be able

  
to say, "Honey, I'm home,"
without paying a royalty!

  
It's an incredible scene
here in downtown Manhattan,

  
where the world anxiously waits,
because for the first time in history,

  
we will hear for ourselves
if a honeybee can actually speak.

  
What have we gotten into here, Barry?

  
It's pretty big, isn't it?

  
I can't believe how many humans
don't work during the day.

  
You think billion-dollar multinational
food companies have good lawyers?

  
Everybody needs to stay
behind the barricade.

  
- What's the matter?
- I don't know, I just got a chill.

  
Well, if it isn't the bee team.

  
You boys work on this?

  
All rise! The Honorable
Judge Bumbleton presiding.

  
All right. Oase number 4475,

  
Superior Oourt of New York,
Barry Bee Benson v. the Honey Industry

  
is now in session.

  
Mr. Montgomery, you're representing
the five food companies collectively?

  
A privilege.

  
Mr. Benson... you're representing
all the bees of the world?

  
I'm kidding. Yes, Your Honor,
we're ready to proceed.

  
Mr. Montgomery,
your opening statement, please.

  
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,

  
my grandmother was a simple woman.

  
Born on a farm, she believed
it was man's divine right

  
to benefit from the bounty
of nature God put before us.

  
If we lived in the topsy-turvy world
Mr. Benson imagines,

  
just think of what would it mean.

  
I would have to negotiate
with the silkworm

  
for the elastic in my britches!

  
Talking bee!

  
How do we know this isn't some sort of

  
holographic motion-picture-capture
Hollywood wizardry?

  
They could be using laser beams!

  
Robotics! Ventriloquism!
Oloning! For all we know,

  
he could be on steroids!

  
Mr. Benson?

  
Ladies and gentlemen,
there's no trickery here.

  
I'm just an ordinary bee.
Honey's pretty important to me.

  
It's important to all bees.
We invented it!

  
We make it. And we protect it
with our lives.

  
Unfortunately, there are
some people in this room

  
who think they can take it from us

  
'cause we're the little guys!
I'm hoping that, after this is all over,

  
you'll see how, by taking our honey,
you not only take everything we have

  
but everything we are!

  
I wish he'd dress like that
all the time. So nice!

  
Oall your first witness.

  
So, Mr. Klauss Vanderhayden
of Honey Farms, big company you have.

  
I suppose so.

  
I see you also own
Honeyburton and Honron!

  
Yes, they provide beekeepers
for our farms.

  
Beekeeper. I find that
to be a very disturbing term.

  
I don't imagine you employ
any bee-free-ers, do you?

  
- No.
- I couldn't hear you.

  
- No.
- No.

  
Because you don't free bees.
You keep bees. Not only that,

  
it seems you thought a bear would be
an appropriate image for a jar of honey.

  
They're very lovable creatures.

  
Yogi Bear, Fozzie Bear, Build-A-Bear.

  
You mean like this?

  
Bears kill bees!

  
How'd you like his head crashing
through your living room?!

  
Biting into your couch!
Spitting out your throw pillows!

  
OK, that's enough. Take him away.

  
So, Mr. Sting, thank you for being here.
Your name intrigues me.

  
- Where have I heard it before?
- I was with a band called The Police.

  
But you've never been
a police officer, have you?

  
No, I haven't.

  
No, you haven't. And so here
we have yet another example

  
of bee culture casually
stolen by a human

  
for nothing more than
a prance-about stage name.

  
Oh, please.

  
Have you ever been stung, Mr. Sting?

  
Because I'm feeling
a little stung, Sting.

  
Or should I say... Mr. Gordon M. Sumner!

  
That's not his real name?! You idiots!

  
Mr. Liotta, first,
belated congratulations on

  
your Emmy win for a guest spot
on ER in 2005.

  
Thank you. Thank you.

  
I see from your resume
that you're devilishly handsome

  
with a churning inner turmoil
that's ready to blow.

  
I enjoy what I do. Is that a crime?

  
Not yet it isn't. But is this
what it's come to for you?

  
Exploiting tiny, helpless bees
so you don't

  
have to rehearse
your part and learn your lines, sir?

  
Watch it, Benson!
I could blow right now!

  
This isn't a goodfella.
This is a badfella!

  
Why doesn't someone just step on
this creep, and we can all go home?!

  
- Order in this court!
- You're all thinking it!

  
Order! Order, I say!

  
- Say it!
- Mr. Liotta, please sit down!

  
I think it was awfully nice
of that bear to pitch in like that.

  
I think the jury's on our side.

  
Are we doing everything right, legally?

  
I'm a florist.

  
Right. Well, here's to a great team.

  
To a great team!

  
Well, hello.

  
- Ken!
- Hello.

  
I didn't think you were coming.

  
No, I was just late.
I tried to call, but... the battery.

  
I didn't want all this to go to waste,
so I called Barry. Luckily, he was free.

  
Oh, that was lucky.

  
There's a little left.
I could heat it up.

  
Yeah, heat it up, sure, whatever.

  
So I hear you're quite a tennis player.

  
I'm not much for the game myself.
The ball's a little grabby.

  
That's where I usually sit.
Right... there.

  
Ken, Barry was looking at your resume,

  
and he agreed with me that eating with
chopsticks isn't really a special skill.

  
You think I don't see what you're doing?

  
I know how hard it is to find
the rightjob. We have that in common.

  
Do we?

  
Bees have 100 percent employment,
but we do jobs like taking the crud out.

  
That's just what
I was thinking about doing.

  
Ken, I let Barry borrow your razor
for his fuzz. I hope that was all right.

  
I'm going to drain the old stinger.

  
Yeah, you do that.

  
Look at that.

  
You know, I've just about had it

  
with your little mind games.

  
- What's that?
- Italian Vogue.

  
Mamma mia, that's a lot of pages.

  
A lot of ads.

  
Remember what Van said, why is
your life more valuable than mine?

  
Funny, I just can't seem to recall that!

  
I think something stinks in here!

  
I love the smell of flowers.

  
How do you like the smell of flames?!

  
Not as much.

  
Water bug! Not taking sides!

  
Ken, I'm wearing a Ohapstick hat!
This is pathetic!

  
I've got issues!

  
Well, well, well, a royal flush!

  
- You're bluffing.
- Am I?

  
Surf's up, dude!

  
Poo water!

  
That bowl is gnarly.

  
Except for those dirty yellow rings!

  
Kenneth! What are you doing?!

  
You know, I don't even like honey!
I don't eat it!

  
We need to talk!

  
He's just a little bee!

  
And he happens to be
the nicest bee I've met in a long time!

  
Long time? What are you talking about?!
Are there other bugs in your life?

  
No, but there are other things bugging
me in life. And you're one of them!

  
Fine! Talking bees, no yogurt night...

  
My nerves are fried from riding
on this emotional roller coaster!

  
Goodbye, Ken.

  
And for your information,

  
I prefer sugar-free, artificial
sweeteners made by man!

  
I'm sorry about all that.

  
I know it's got
an aftertaste! I like it!

  
I always felt there was some kind
of barrier between Ken and me.

  
I couldn't overcome it.
Oh, well.

  
Are you OK for the trial?

  
I believe Mr. Montgomery
is about out of ideas.

  
We would like to call
Mr. Barry Benson Bee to the stand.

  
Good idea! You can really see why he's
considered one of the best lawyers...

  
Yeah.

  
Layton, you've
gotta weave some magic

  
with this jury,
or it's gonna be all over.

  
Don't worry. The only thing I have
to do to turn this jury around

  
is to remind them
of what they don't like about bees.

  
- You got the tweezers?
- Are you allergic?

  
Only to losing, son. Only to losing.

  
Mr. Benson Bee, I'll ask you
what I think we'd all like to know.

  
What exactly is your relationship

  
to that woman?

  
We're friends.

  
- Good friends?
- Yes.

  
How good? Do you live together?

  
Wait a minute...

  
Are you her little...

  
...bedbug?

  
I've seen a bee documentary or two.
From what I understand,

  
doesn't your queen give birth
to all the bee children?

  
- Yeah, but...
- So those aren't your real parents!

  
- Oh, Barry...
- Yes, they are!

  
Hold me back!

  
You're an illegitimate bee,
aren't you, Benson?

  
He's denouncing bees!

  
Don't y'all date your cousins?

  
- Objection!
- I'm going to pincushion this guy!

  
Adam, don't! It's what he wants!

  
Oh, I'm hit!!

  
Oh, lordy, I am hit!

  
Order! Order!

  
The venom! The venom
is coursing through my veins!

  
I have been felled
by a winged beast of destruction!

  
You see? You can't treat them
like equals! They're striped savages!

  
Stinging's the only thing
they know! It's their way!

  
- Adam, stay with me.
- I can't feel my legs.

  
What angel of mercy
will come forward to suck the poison

  
from my heaving buttocks?

  
I will have order in this court. Order!

  
Order, please!

  
The case of the honeybees
versus the human race

  
took a pointed turn against the bees

  
yesterday when one of their legal
team stung Layton T. Montgomery.

  
- Hey, buddy.
- Hey.

  
- Is there much pain?
- Yeah.

  
I...

  
I blew the whole case, didn't I?

  
It doesn't matter. What matters is
you're alive. You could have died.

  
I'd be better off dead. Look at me.

  
They got it from the cafeteria
downstairs, in a tuna sandwich.

  
Look, there's
a little celery still on it.

  
What was it like to sting someone?

  
I can't explain it. It was all...

  
All adrenaline and then...
and then ecstasy!

  
All right.

  
You think it was all a trap?

  
Of course. I'm sorry.
I flew us right into this.

  
What were we thinking? Look at us. We're
just a couple of bugs in this world.

  
What will the humans do to us
if they win?

  
I don't know.

  
I hear they put the roaches in motels.
That doesn't sound so bad.

  
Adam, they check in,
but they don't check out!

  
Oh, my.

  
Oould you get a nurse
to close that window?

  
- Why?
- The smoke.

  
Bees don't smoke.

  
Right. Bees don't smoke.

  
Bees don't smoke!
But some bees are smoking.

  
That's it! That's our case!

  
It is? It's not over?

  
Get dressed. I've gotta go somewhere.

  
Get back to the court and stall.
Stall any way you can.

  
And assuming you've done step correctly, you're ready for the tub.

  
Mr. Flayman.

  
Yes? Yes, Your Honor!

  
Where is the rest of your team?

  
Well, Your Honor, it's interesting.

  
Bees are trained to fly haphazardly,

  
and as a result,
we don't make very good time.

  
I actually heard a funny story about...

  
Your Honor,
haven't these ridiculous bugs

  
taken up enough
of this court's valuable time?

  
How much longer will we allow
these absurd shenanigans to go on?

  
They have presented no compelling
evidence to support their charges

  
against my clients,
who run legitimate businesses.

  
I move for a complete dismissal
of this entire case!

  
Mr. Flayman, I'm afraid I'm going

  
to have to consider
Mr. Montgomery's motion.

  
But you can't! We have a terrific case.

  
Where is your proof?
Where is the evidence?

  
Show me the smoking gun!

  
Hold it, Your Honor!
You want a smoking gun?

  
Here is your smoking gun.

  
What is that?

  
It's a bee smoker!

  
What, this?
This harmless little contraption?

  
This couldn't hurt a fly,
let alone a bee.

  
Look at what has happened

  
to bees who have never been asked,
"Smoking or non?"

  
Is this what nature intended for us?

  
To be forcibly addicted
to smoke machines

  
and man-made wooden slat work camps?

  
Living out our lives as honey slaves
to the white man?

  
- What are we gonna do?
- He's playing the species card.

  
Ladies and gentlemen, please,
free these bees!

  
Free the bees! Free the bees!

  
Free the bees!

  
Free the bees! Free the bees!

  
The court finds in favor of the bees!

  
Vanessa, we won!

  
I knew you could do it! High-five!

  
Sorry.

  
I'm OK! You know what this means?

  
All the honey
will finally belong to the bees.

  
Now we won't have
to work so hard all the time.

  
This is an unholy perversion
of the balance of nature, Benson.

  
You'll regret this.

  
Barry, how much honey is out there?

  
All right. One at a time.

  
Barry, who are you wearing?

  
My sweater is Ralph Lauren,
and I have no pants.

  
- What if Montgomery's right?
- What do you mean?

  
We've been living the bee way
a long time, 27 million years.

  
Oongratulations on your victory.
What will you demand as a settlement?

  
First, we'll demand a complete shutdown
of all bee work camps.

  
Then we want back the honey
that was ours to begin with,

  
every last drop.

  
We demand an end to the glorification
of the bear as anything more

  
than a filthy, smelly,
bad-breath stink machine.

  
We're all aware
of what they do in the woods.

  
Wait for my signal.

  
Take him out.

  
He'll have nauseous
for a few hours, then he'll be fine.

  
And we will no longer tolerate
bee-negative nicknames...

  
But it's just a prance-about stage name!

  
...unnecessary inclusion of honey
in bogus health products

  
and la-dee-da human
tea-time snack garnishments.

  
Oan't breathe.

  
Bring it in, boys!

  
Hold it right there! Good.

  
Tap it.

  
Mr. Buzzwell, we just passed three cups,
and there's gallons more coming!

  
- I think we need to shut down!
- Shut down? We've never shut down.

  
Shut down honey production!

  
Stop making honey!

  
Turn your key, sir!

  
What do we do now?

  
Oannonball!

  
We're shutting honey production!

  
Mission abort.

  
Aborting pollination and nectar detail.
Returning to base.

  
Adam, you wouldn't believe
how much honey was out there.

  
Oh, yeah?

  
What's going on? Where is everybody?

  
- Are they out celebrating?
- They're home.

  
They don't know what to do.
Laying out, sleeping in.

  
I heard your Uncle Oarl was on his way
to San Antonio with a cricket.

  
At least we got our honey back.

  
Sometimes I think, so what if humans
liked our honey? Who wouldn't?

  
It's the greatest thing in the world!
I was excited to be part of making it.

  
This was my new desk. This was my
new job. I wanted to do it really well.

  
And now...

  
Now I can't.

  
I don't understand
why they're not happy.

  
I thought their lives would be better!

  
They're doing nothing. It's amazing.
Honey really changes people.

  
You don't have any idea
what's going on, do you?

  
- What did you want to show me?
- This.

  
What happened here?

  
That is not the half of it.

  
Oh, no. Oh, my.

  
They're all wilting.

  
Doesn't look very good, does it?

  
No.

  
And whose fault do you think that is?

  
You know, I'm gonna guess bees.

  
Bees?

  
Specifically, me.

  
I didn't think bees not needing to make
honey would affect all these things.

  
It's notjust flowers.
Fruits, vegetables, they all need bees.

  
That's our whole SAT test right there.

  
Take away produce, that affects
the entire animal kingdom.

  
And then, of course...

  
The human species?

  
So if there's no more pollination,

  
it could all just go south here,
couldn't it?

  
I know this is also partly my fault.

  
How about a suicide pact?

  
How do we do it?

  
- I'll sting you, you step on me.
- That just kills you twice.

  
Right, right.

  
Listen, Barry...
sorry, but I gotta get going.

  
I had to open my mouth and talk.

  
Vanessa?

  
Vanessa? Why are you leaving?
Where are you going?

  
To the final Tournament of Roses parade
in Pasadena.

  
They've moved it to this weekend
because all the flowers are dying.

  
It's the last chance
I'll ever have to see it.

  
Vanessa, I just wanna say I'm sorry.
I never meant it to turn out like this.

  
I know. Me neither.

  
Tournament of Roses.
Roses can't do sports.

  
Wait a minute. Roses. Roses?

  
Roses!

  
Vanessa!

  
Roses?!

  
Barry?

  
- Roses are flowers!
- Yes, they are.

  
Flowers, bees, pollen!

  
I know.
That's why this is the last parade.

  
Maybe not.
Oould you ask him to slow down?

  
Oould you slow down?

  
Barry!

  
OK, I made a huge mistake.
This is a total disaster, all my fault.

  
Yes, it kind of is.

  
I've ruined the planet.
I wanted to help you

  
with the flower shop.
I've made it worse.

  
Actually, it's completely closed down.

  
I thought maybe you were remodeling.

  
But I have another idea, and it's
greater than my previous ideas combined.

  
I don't want to hear it!

  
All right, they have the roses,
the roses have the pollen.

  
I know every bee, plant
and flower bud in this park.

  
All we gotta do is get what they've got
back here with what we've got.

  
- Bees.
- Park.

  
- Pollen!
- Flowers.

  
- Repollination!
- Across the nation!

  
Tournament of Roses,
Pasadena, Oalifornia.

  
They've got nothing
but flowers, floats and cotton candy.

  
Security will be tight.

  
I have an idea.

  
Vanessa Bloome, FTD.

  
Official floral business. It's real.

  
Sorry, ma'am. Nice brooch.

  
Thank you. It was a gift.

  
Once inside,
we just pick the right float.

  
How about The Princess and the Pea?

  
I could be the princess,
and you could be the pea!

  
Yes, I got it.

  
- Where should I sit?
- What are you?

  
- I believe I'm the pea.
- The pea?

  
It goes under the mattresses.

  
- Not in this fairy tale, sweetheart.
- I'm getting the marshal.

  
You do that!
This whole parade is a fiasco!

  
Let's see what this baby'll do.

  
Hey, what are you doing?!

  
Then all we do
is blend in with traffic...

  
...without arousing suspicion.

  
Once at the airport,
there's no stopping us.

  
Stop! Security.

  
- You and your insect pack your float?
- Yes.

  
Has it been
in your possession the entire time?

  
Would you remove your shoes?

  
- Remove your stinger.
- It's part of me.

  
I know. Just having some fun.
Enjoy your flight.

  
Then if we're lucky, we'll have
just enough pollen to do the job.

  
Oan you believe how lucky we are? We
have just enough pollen to do the job!

  
I think this is gonna work.

  
It's got to work.

  
Attention, passengers,
this is Oaptain Scott.

  
We have a bit of bad weather
in New York.

  
It looks like we'll experience
a couple hours delay.

  
Barry, these are cut flowers
with no water. They'll never make it.

  
I gotta get up there
and talk to them.

  
Be careful.

  
Oan I get help
with the Sky Mall magazine?

  
I'd like to order the talking
inflatable nose and ear hair trimmer.

  
Oaptain, I'm in a real situation.

  
- What'd you say, Hal?
- Nothing.

  
Bee!

  
Don't freak out! My entire species...

  
What are you doing?

  
- Wait a minute! I'm an attorney!
- Who's an attorney?

  
Don't move.

  
Oh, Barry.

  
Good afternoon, passengers.
This is your captain.

  
Would a Miss Vanessa Bloome in 24B
please report to the cockpit?

  
And please hurry!

  
What happened here?

  
There was a DustBuster,
a toupee, a life raft exploded.

  
One's bald, one's in a boat,
they're both unconscious!

  
- Is that another bee joke?
- No!

  
No one's flying the plane!

  
This is JFK control tower, Flight 356.
What's your status?

  
This is Vanessa Bloome.
I'm a florist from New York.

  
Where's the pilot?

  
He's unconscious,
and so is the copilot.

  
Not good. Does anyone onboard
have flight experience?

  
As a matter of fact, there is.

  
- Who's that?
- Barry Benson.

  
From the honey trial?! Oh, great.

  
Vanessa, this is nothing more
than a big metal bee.

  
It's got giant wings, huge engines.

  
I can't fly a plane.

  
- Why not? Isn't John Travolta a pilot?
- Yes.

  
How hard could it be?

  
Wait, Barry!
We're headed into some lightning.

  
This is Bob Bumble. We have some
late-breaking news from JFK Airport,

  
where a suspenseful scene
is developing.

  
Barry Benson,
fresh from his legal victory...

  
That's Barry!

  
...is attempting to land a plane,
loaded with people, flowers

  
and an incapacitated flight crew.

  
Flowers?!

  
We have a storm in the area
and two individuals at the controls

  
with absolutely no flight experience.

  
Just a minute.
There's a bee on that plane.

  
I'm quite familiar with Mr. Benson
and his no-account compadres.

  
They've done enough damage.

  
But isn't he your only hope?

  
Technically, a bee
shouldn't be able to fly at all.

  
Their wings are too small...

  
Haven't we heard this a million times?

  
"The surface area of the wings
and body mass make no sense."

  
- Get this on the air!
- Got it.

  
- Stand by.
- We're going live.

  
The way we work may be a mystery to you.

  
Making honey takes a lot of bees
doing a lot of small jobs.

  
But let me tell you about a small job.

  
If you do it well,
it makes a big difference.

  
More than we realized.
To us, to everyone.

  
That's why I want to get bees
back to working together.

  
That's the bee way!
We're not made of Jell-O.

  
We get behind a fellow.

  
- Black and yellow!
- Hello!

  
Left, right, down, hover.

  
- Hover?
- Forget hover.

  
This isn't so hard.
Beep-beep! Beep-beep!

  
Barry, what happened?!

  
Wait, I think we were
on autopilot the whole time.

  
- That may have been helping me.
- And now we're not!

  
So it turns out I cannot fly a plane.

  
All of you, let's get
behind this fellow! Move it out!

  
Move out!

  
Our only chance is if I do what I'd do,
you copy me with the wings of the plane!

  
Don't have to yell.

  
I'm not yelling!
We're in a lot of trouble.

  
It's very hard to concentrate
with that panicky tone in your voice!

  
It's not a tone. I'm panicking!

  
I can't do this!

  
Vanessa, pull yourself together.
You have to snap out of it!

  
You snap out of it.

  
You snap out of it.

  
- You snap out of it!
- You snap out of it!

  
- You snap out of it!
- You snap out of it!

  
- You snap out of it!
- You snap out of it!

  
- Hold it!
- Why? Oome on, it's my turn.

  
How is the plane flying?

  
I don't know.

  
Hello?

  
Benson, got any flowers
for a happy occasion in there?

  
The Pollen Jocks!

  
They do get behind a fellow.

  
- Black and yellow.
- Hello.

  
All right, let's drop this tin can
on the blacktop.

  
Where? I can't see anything. Oan you?

  
No, nothing. It's all cloudy.

  
Oome on. You got to think bee, Barry.

  
- Thinking bee.
- Thinking bee.

  
Thinking bee!
Thinking bee! Thinking bee!

  
Wait a minute.
I think I'm feeling something.

  
- What?
- I don't know. It's strong, pulling me.

  
Like a 27-million-year-old instinct.

  
Bring the nose down.

  
Thinking bee!
Thinking bee! Thinking bee!

  
- What in the world is on the tarmac?
- Get some lights on that!

  
Thinking bee!
Thinking bee! Thinking bee!

  
- Vanessa, aim for the flower.
- OK.

  
Out the engines. We're going in
on bee power. Ready, boys?

  
Affirmative!

  
Good. Good. Easy, now. That's it.

  
Land on that flower!

  
Ready? Full reverse!

  
Spin it around!

  
- Not that flower! The other one!
- Which one?

  
- That flower.
- I'm aiming at the flower!

  
That's a fat guy in a flowered shirt.
I mean the giant pulsating flower

  
made of millions of bees!

  
Pull forward. Nose down. Tail up.

  
Rotate around it.

  
- This is insane, Barry!
- This's the only way I know how to fly.

  
Am I koo-koo-kachoo, or is this plane
flying in an insect-like pattern?

  
Get your nose in there. Don't be afraid.
Smell it. Full reverse!

  
Just drop it. Be a part of it.

  
Aim for the center!

  
Now drop it in! Drop it in, woman!

  
Oome on, already.

  
Barry, we did it!
You taught me how to fly!

  
- Yes. No high-five!
- Right.

  
Barry, it worked!
Did you see the giant flower?

  
What giant flower? Where? Of course
I saw the flower! That was genius!

  
- Thank you.
- But we're not done yet.

  
Listen, everyone!

  
This runway is covered
with the last pollen

  
from the last flowers
available anywhere on Earth.

  
That means this is our last chance.

  
We're the only ones who make honey,
pollinate flowers and dress like this.

  
If we're gonna survive as a species,
this is our moment! What do you say?

  
Are we going to be bees, orjust
Museum of Natural History keychains?

  
We're bees!

  
Keychain!

  
Then follow me! Except Keychain.

  
Hold on, Barry. Here.

  
You've earned this.

  
Yeah!

  
I'm a Pollen Jock! And it's a perfect
fit. All I gotta do are the sleeves.

  
Oh, yeah.

  
That's our Barry.

  
Mom! The bees are back!

  
If anybody needs
to make a call, now's the time.

  
I got a feeling we'll be
working late tonight!

  
Here's your change. Have a great
afternoon! Oan I help who's next?

  
Would you like some honey with that?
It is bee-approved. Don't forget these.

  
Milk, cream, cheese, it's all me.
And I don't see a nickel!

  
Sometimes I just feel
like a piece of meat!

  
I had no idea.

  
Barry, I'm sorry.
Have you got a moment?

  
Would you excuse me?
My mosquito associate will help you.

  
Sorry I'm late.

  
He's a lawyer too?

  
I was already a blood-sucking parasite.
All I needed was a briefcase.

  
Have a great afternoon!

  
Barry, I just got this huge tulip order,
and I can't get them anywhere.

  
No problem, Vannie.
Just leave it to me.

  
You're a lifesaver, Barry.
Oan I help who's next?

  
All right, scramble, jocks!
It's time to fly.

  
Thank you, Barry!

  
That bee is living my life!

  
Let it go, Kenny.

  
- When will this nightmare end?!
- Let it all go.

  
- Beautiful day to fly.
- Sure is.

  
Between you and me,
I was dying to get out of that office.

  
You have got
to start thinking bee, my friend.

  
- Thinking bee!
- Me?

  
Hold it. Let's just stop
for a second. Hold it.

  
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, everyone.
Oan we stop here?

  
I'm not making a major life decision
during a production number!

  
All right. Take ten, everybody.
Wrap it up, guys.

  
I had virtually no rehearsal for that.

,
Dear Senator Pell:
Economic sanctions are being used more frequently as a tool of foreign policy. As you
requested, this report analyzes (1) what political goals economic sanctions can and cannot
achieve; (2) the social, economic, political, and psychological effects of the measures; and (3)
the situations in which sanctions are likely to succeed and when they may fail.
We plan no further distribution of this report until 30 days after its issue date, unless you publicly announce its contents earlier. At that time, we will send copies of this report to the Secretaries of State, Commerce, and the Treasury and to other interested congressional committees.
Copies will also be made available to others upon request.
Please contact me at (202) 275-48 12 if you or your staff have any questions concerning this
report. The major contributors to this report are listed in appendix II.
Sincerely yours,
Allan I. Mendelowitz, Director
International Trade, Energy,
and Finance Issues 
Executive Summary
Purpose The United States and other nations use economic sanctions as an
important tool of foreign policy, and sanctions have been used with greater
frequency in recent years.
At  the request of the Chairman, Senate Committee on Foreign Relations,
analyzed (1) the political goals economic sanctions can and cannot
achieve; (2) the social, economic, political, and psychological effects of
sanctions; and (3) the circumstances when sanctions are likely to succeed
and those when they may fail.  examined 27 episodes from the
post-World War I period that were particularly illustrative of sanctions’
effects. While this historical record cannot yield exact or definitive rules
that predict how sanctions might succeed in any future case, it does
provide lessons that would be appropriate to consider in evaluating other
cases where sanctions might be imposed.
Background Economic sanctions used for foreign policy purposes are economic
penalties, such as prohibiting trade, stopping financial transactions, or barring economic and military assistance, used to achieve the goal of influencing the target nation. Sanctions can be imposed selectively, stopping
only certain trade and financial transactions or aid programs, or comprehensively, halting all economic relations with the target nation. Sanctions
often are imposed when domestic pressure for action exists, but diplomacy
or propaganda would be too mild a response, yet the most severe
responses, covert action or military action, would be too severe.
Results in Brief Sanctions can be imposed to serve multiple goals. The measures are more
successful in achieving the less ambitious and often unarticulated goals of
(1) upholding international norms by punishing the target nation for unacceptable behavior and (2) deterring future objectionable actions. However, &
they are usually less successful in achieving the most prominently stated
goal of making the target country comply with the sanctioning nation’s
stated wishes. Thus, excessive expectations are often formed about what
sanctions can achieve.
Economic sanctions can raise the cost of trade and finance to the targeted
nations, but in most cases have not ruined their economies. (Sanctions can
also hurt the sanctioning nation by ending mutually beneficial commercial
transactions.) The extent of actual economic damage to the target nation,
however, does not often determine the success of sanctions; the threat of
damage from further sanctions is often more powerful. Actual damage
Page 2 /-92-106 Economic Sanctions 
Executive Summary
rarely compares with threatened pain because of the illicit evasion of
sanctions and the legal redirection of the target’s trade and financial flows.
Economic sanctions are most effective when they are applied multilaterally
or against otherwise friendly nations with economic and political ties to the
sanctioning country. Cultural characteristics of the target nation and international publicity can either enhance or weaken the effect of the measures.
If the target nation has a strong shame and honor code-that is, if “saving
face” is important-or if sanctions receive substantial publicity, sanctions
may create a backlash in the target nation, particularly if harsh, comprehensive measures are used from the onset of sanctions. If international
publicity enhances the threat of further sanctions, however, then it may
cause effective psychological pressure on the target.
’s Analysis
Economic Sanctions Can
Achieve Realistic Goals
The historical record suggests some common elements in successful
sanctions, particularly if success is judged by more realistic goals rather
than those often stated by analysts and policymakers. The prevailing belief
in the academic and business communities that sanctions are generally
“ineffective” has been reached by comparing the results of sanctions
against their publicly revealed primary goal. This goal is often presented in
terms of making the target nation comply with the policy goals of the sanctioning nation-for example, ending the apartheid system of racial segregation in South Africa or compelling Iraq to withdraw from Kuwait. Yet,
policymakers in the sanctioning nation may have incentives to overstate
this primary objective. The real goals of sanctions may be unarticulated
and more modest. a
Other goals of sanctions, such as demonstrating national resolve or
punishing misbehavior of the target to uphold international norms or deter
future unacceptable actions, may be more crucial than the stated primary
goal. These goals may in fact be the motivating factors for imposing economic sanctions. And, sanctions are often better at fulfilling these other
goals. For example, the publicly perceived primary purpose of U.S. sanctions in 1980 against the Soviet Union was to compel Soviet withdrawal
from its invasion of Afghanistan. Yet, evidence indicates that President
Jimmy Carter believed the more realistic and important objectives of sanctions were showing resolve and deterring Soviet incursions into Iran,
Page 3 /-92-100 Economic Sanctions 
Executive hmuuuy
Pakistan, or the Persian Gulf, which he considered strategically more
important.
Sanctions Raise the Cost of Sanctions can raise the cost of trade and finance for the target nation but
Commerce usually do not ruin its economy. Over time, the target nation can develop
new suppliers and markets, although at increased cost. For example, South
Africa, the target of multilateral boycotts, replaced most lost exports in
2 years, but incurred losses from discounts on the prices of its products
and the added transportation costs required to develop alternative markets. Sanctions can also raise costs for the sanctioning nation, including
lost profits of forgone exports and financial transactions and additional
expenses from purchasing more expensive imports from alternative suppliers.
When used together, the different economic effects of export, import, and
financial sanctions frequently reinforce each other. Such measures, however, are blunt tools with limited ability to focus economic pressure against
particular groups in the target society. For example, U.S. financial sanctions against Panama, designed to hurt the Panamanian government while
sparing the economy, had substantial inadvertent adverse impact on the
economy and nontargeted population groups.
Noneconomic Factors Often The effectiveness of sanctions is not primarily determined by the economic
Determine the Outcome of damage they inflict. Sanctions work best when there is strong internal
Economic Sanctions political opposition to the target government, particularly internationally
oriented commercial interests that want to retain business ties with the
country imposing the sanctions. Where significant political opposition
exists, imposing selected sanctions with the threat of more severe measures to follow often causes the opposition to pressure the target nation’s a
government to acceed to the sanctioning nation’s wishes. The success of
the sanctions thus is more closely related to the threatened damage of subsequent measures than it is to the economic damage of sanctions actually
in place. In the case of multilateral sanctions against South Africa, for
example, measures of moderate economic effect raised fears of future
sanctions among more liberal white businessmen opposed to the policy of
apartheid. Their lobbying for change helped create pressure for the
reforms instituted in South Africa.
Even with significant internal political opposition (and even more so
without it), imposing harsh, comprehensive sanctions immediately may be
Executive Summary
counterproductive. The target government may use the severe economic
pain to rally its population in the face of an external enemy. In the early to
mid-1960s, Fidel Castro used the harsh effects of the comprehensive U.S.
embargo to win additional popular support in Cuba.
International cooperation enhances the possibility that sanctions will succeed. Multilateral sanctions have more political legitimacy and inflict
greater isolation on the target nation than do unilateral measures. The
effectiveness of multilateral sanctions can be counterproductive, however,
when disagreements among sanctioning nations impair the appearance of
resolve aimed at the target. For example, western unity broke down in an
intra-alliance dispute about whether to embargo the export of equipment
to the Soviet Union that could be used to construct a natural gas pipeline.
A friendly target nation seeking to preserve political and economic ties to
the sanctioning state has incentives to acceed to the sanctioning state.
Sanctions can be counterproductive, however, if they are so severe and
comprehensive that the target nation seeks greater ties to adversaries of
the sanctioning nation.
Sanctions that ostracize the target nation can be effective when that
nation’s culture is similar to the sanctioning nation’s; sanctions generally
fail when cultural norms in the target nation demand resistance to “save
face.” International publicity may exacerbate the backlash in the target
nation if harsh, comprehensive measures are used; such publicity, however, can enhance the threat of future measures and is vital if deterring a
nation from unacceptable behavior or showing support for its political
opposition is the goal.
Recommendations While this report contains no recommendations, it provides insights into a
factors that should be considered in evaluating any future use of economic
sanctions.
Agency Comments In conducting its study,  discussed the issues involved with officials of
the Departments of State, Commerce, and the Treasury, as well as with
many outside experts on sanctions, and their views were considered in preparing  this report. However, in accordance with the requester’s wishes,
did not request written agency comments on a draft of the report.

Chapter 1
Introduction
Economic sanctions have been used by nations as a foreign policy tool for
centuries. Sanctions were imposed in ancient Greece in 432 B.C. during
events leading to the Peloponnesian War between Athens and Sparta. The
United States used sanctions against the British and French from 1808 to
1809 to try to get them to make concessions on the rights of neutral states.
Since the late 195Os, the use of sanctions has been particularly widespread.
The most recent episodes of sanctions include multilateral measures
against South Africa imposed in 1985 and 1986 in response to its policies
of racial segregation, U.S. financial sanctions against Panama in 1988 to
destabilize the government of General Manuel Noreiga, selected embargoes
on China in 1989 after its repression of political dissent, most visible in
Tiananmen Square, and the comprehensive United Nations (U.N.) trade
quarantine against Iraq in 1990 after it invaded Kuwait.
Despite the liberal use of sanctions by governments in recent times, there
is considerable controversy over their effectiveness. According to one side
of the argument, sanctions are ineffective. According to this perspective, in
an interdependent trading world where multiple buyers and suppliers exist
for particular goods and services, it is difficult to devastate the target
economy with sanctions. Even in the rare cases in which substantial economic pressure can be brought to bear, the government in the target state
often will remain politically intransigent in the face of an external challenge
and can even benefit by using sanctions to increase its standing among its
population.
Opposing this view is a growing number of academic analysts who
recognize that sanctions are often employed when there is domestic
pressure in the sanctioning state to take some action against the target
nation, but diplomatic measures are perceived as too weak and military
action is seen as too strong. This perspective believes sanctions can be
used to send important signals to other nations and deter them from displaying future objectionable behavior.
To achieve their political goals, sanctions can be designed to inflict varying
degrees of economic pressure. In analyzing past episodes of sanctions, we
recognized three categories of sanctions in order of declining economic
severity.
1. Instrumental sanctions. These are measures designed to prevent the
target country from obtaining specific goods or financial capital. The
post-World War II western embargoes on military-related technology to
communist nations illustrate the military goal. During the Cold War, the

Introduction
Coordinating Committee, often referred to as COCOM, an informal
association of western nations, was set up to control exports of civilian
technology that could be used to enhance the military capabilities of communist nations. Comprehensive trade and financial sanctions imposed by
the United Nations in 1990 against Iraq represented an attempt to choke
off the country’s commerce and limit its ability to wage war by denying it
military equipment and spare parts. The unprecedented degree of cooperation among the sanctioning nations and the military blockade to enforce
the measures were designed to severely cripple the Iraqi economy. The
goals were to pressure a withdrawal from Kuwait and to impede the ability
of the Iraqi military to fight a war.
2. Punitive sanctions. These are measures designed to punish the target
economically for unacceptable behavior. These sanctions usually do not
prevent the target nation from obtaining goods or capital, but can impose
substantial economic costs. Policymakers in the nations that impose
sanctions resign themselves to the target’s developing alternative markets
or suppliers. For example, U.S. restrictions imposed in 1981 and 1982 on
new credit, high technology exports, preferential trade status, and
International Monetary Fund membership for Poland were designed to
punish that country for imposing martial law and suppressing the Solidarity trade union. Poland was still able to trade and get credit, but sanctions still exerted moderate economic pressure.
3. Symbolic sanctions. These are measures whose economic effects are so
slight that sanctioning nations do not expect them to cause great economic
harm to the target. The mild 1989 western embargoes on arms exports and
multilateral loans to the People’s Republic of China after the suppression
of dissidents in Tiananmen Square illustrate this type of sanction. The U.S.
goal was to send a signal of disapproval to the Chinese government, while
maintaining commercial relations. a
Objectives, Scope, and At the request of Senator Claiborne PelI, Chairman of the Senate
Methodology Committee on Foreign Relations, we analyzed (1) what political goals economic sanctions can and cannot achieve; (2) the social, economic, political, and psychological effects of sanctions; and (3) the situations in which
they are likely to succeed and those in which they are likely to fail.
To address issues concerning the effectiveness of economic sanctions as a
foreign policy tool, we conducted in-depth examinations of 27 illustrative
episodes of sanctions imposed during the post-World War I period, most of

which were recent cases. These cases are listed in appendix I. We
interviewed and obtained documentation from officials of the Departments
of State, Commerce, and the Treasury and representatives of U.S. business
groups. We also interviewed researchers at universities and relied on academic journal articles and books for information on sanctions. We incorporated our prior work on U.S. sanctions against Libya, Panama, and South
Africa into the report. A listing of our related products on sanctions is
attached.
We performed our work from June 1990 to April 199 1 in accordance with
generally accepted government auditing standards.
In conducting our study, we discussed the issues involved with officials of
the Departments of State, Commerce, and the Treasury, as well as with
many outside experts on sanctions, and their views were considered in preparing this report. However, in accordance with the requester’s wishes, we
did not request written agency comments on a draft of the report.

The Foreign Policy Goals of Economic
Sanctions
Economic sanctions can attempt to induce compliance with the sanctioning
nation’s foreign policy goals, enhance that country’s prestige or status, or
punish or deter target nations. Each episode of sanctions can serve more
than one of these goals; therefore, effectiveness of the measures should not
be evaluated only on the basis of the target nation’s compliance with publicly stated objectives or demands.
Sanctions Have Diverse The economic sanctions dicussed in this report are foreign policy tools.
Goals Their goals are political rather than economic in nature, in that they are
imposed by one nation to change the policy of another nation, enhance the
standing of the sanctioning nation, or deter potential policies or actions of
other nations. Governments are often willing to accept economic losses
when imposing sanctions in anticipation of achieving overriding political or
foreign policy goals. (The terms “political goals” and “foreign policy
goals” are used interchangeably in the analytical literature. Economic
penalties used for economic gain-for example, import duties-are not usually considered economic sanctions by the literature.)
An assessment of the success of economic sanctions should focus on their
effectiveness in achieving these overriding goals, rather than measuring
the degree of economic pressure brought to bear on a target nation. One
study cites three types of political or foreign policy goals for economic
sanctions.
1. Primary goals. These are the publicly revealed objectives of the nation
imposing sanctions, usually presented in terms of making the target
comply with its wishes. For example, the United Nations imposed sanctions
against the white minority-ruled government in Rhodesia in 1966 to
compel it to institute a system of majority rule. The primary goal of sanctions is usually the most difficult to achieve. b
2. Secondary goals. These objectives entail symbolically enhancing the
prestige or status of the sanctioning government. Sanctions can increase
prestige internationally by making a moral statement against the target’s
behavior. For example, U.S. import and export sanctions in 1978 against
the Idi Amin government in Uganda for violations of human rights satisfied
this goal.
Sanctions can also increase the standing of the sanctioning government in
the eyes of its domestic interest groups. For example, selective sanctions
placed against South Africa by the governments of many western industrial

Sanctions

Modest Goals -
nations were a moral statement against its policy of racial segregation.
These sanctions won the western governments greater support from their
own domestic antiapartheid groups.
3. Tertiary goals. These are goals that affect the international system. Sanctions, or the threat of them, can punish a nation for the violation of international norms. They also can act as a symbol of resolve by the sanctioning
nation to deter the target or other nations from displaying future unacceptable behavior. In the mid-l 98Os, the United States placed fairly
comprehensive unilateral trade and financial sanctions on Libya to punish
it for state-sponsored terrorism and intervention against neighboring
states. Also, western nations threatened to impose sanctions against the
Soviet Union if it invaded Poland to suppress the Solidarity trade union in
198 1. According to one analyst, this threat could have resulted in the decision in Moscow to repress Solidarity by the Polish government’s imposition
of martial law rather than by a Soviet invasion. A Soviet invasion would
have been perceived as a greater threat to the West.
Despite the usual focus on the publicly revealed primary goal, sanctions
often can and do have more than one goal. When assessing the effectiveness of sanctions, all goals to be achieved must be kept in mind: (1) public
and private and (2) primary, secondary, and tertiary. Policymakers often
overstate the publicly revealed primary goal to win acceptance of sanctions
by their domestic public or to establish a strong bargaining position to
achieve a better eventual settlement with the target. Such overstatement
leads to excessive expectations about what sanctions can achieve. Using
only the achievement of the publicly revealed goal to determine the
“success” or “failure” of sanctions is inadequate. Sanctions are usually
least effective in achieving this goal. Evaluating sanctions based only on
the publicly revealed goal biases the analysis toward finding that the mea- a
sure9 are rarely effective.
When evaluated against the achievement of secondary and tertiary goals,
however, sanctions are more successful. In fact, rather than being imposed
to achieve the publicly revealed goal of target compliance, sanctions are
most often imposed when public pressure in the sanctioning nation
demands a stronger response to the target’s unacceptable behavior than
diplomatic action or when signaling or deterrence is the goal. In some
cases, such measures seek to deter by showing that the sanctioning nation
is willing to escalate to military action if the target continues the
objectionable behavior.
Page 12 /-92-106 Economic Sanctions 
Chapter 2
The Foreign Policy Goals of Economic
sanctione
For example, the publicly perceived purpose of the major actions taken by
the United States in 1980 against the Soviet Union-the grain embargo,
restrictions on high technology exports to that country, and the U.S. boycott of the Moscow Olympic games-was to induce a Soviet withdrawal
from Afghanistan. Yet, statements by then-President Carter showed that he
also had more modest goals. His speeches indicated that he wanted to
deter the Soviet Union from attacking Iran or Pakistan or from attempting
to gain control over Persian Gulf oil, all of which he considered
strategically more important. The following statements reflect this concern:
. ..A Soviet-occupied Afghanistan threatens both Iran and Pakistan and is a steppingstone to
possible control over much of the world’s oil supplies.
. ..There was no doubt that the Soviet move into Afghanistan, if done without adverse consequences, would have resulted in the temptation to move again and again until they reached
warm water ports or until they acquired control over a major portion of the world’s oil supplies.
In this case, some analysts have focused on the publicly perceived primary
goal, concluding that sanctions were a failure since they did not compel
Soviet withdrawal. If the tertiary goal of deterrence is used, evaluating success is harder. Such evaluation depends on determining Soviet intentions
and contrasting those with their actual behavior. It is difficult to determine
whether the Soviets intended to take further military action against other
nations and whether U.S. sanctions deterred them from doing so by
threatening escalation to stronger measures. Yet, given the strategic nature
of the Near East region and the level of U.S. concern, a stronger signal than
diplomatic protests may have been warranted. Thus, the function of sanctions as a potential deterrent was more important than the primary goal of
inducing Soviet withdrawal. In sum, although evaluating the success of
secondary and tertiary objectives is more difficult than assessing whether L
the primary goal has been achieved, this does not detract from their usefulness in achieving these ends.

Chapter 3
The Economic Effects of Sanctions
Economic sanctions can raise the costs of trade and finance to the target
nation and can slow economic growth but usually do not wreck its
economy. Market forces often reinforce import and financial sanctions but
undermine export embargoes. Although export, import, and financial sanctions each have unique consequences, their effects can reinforce each
other. However, sanctions have many collateral effects on the economy of
the target nation and cannot be used effectively as a precision instrument
to hurt specific population groups.
Sanctions Raise the Sanctions can raise the cost for the target nation to conduct trade and
Cost of Commerce to finance activities but usually do not cause extensive damage. As nations in
the international system become more interdependent and the volume of
Both the Target and world trade and financial transactions increases, it is increasingly difficult
the Sanctioning Nation to completely isolate a target nation from supplies of imports, markets for
exports, and financial inflows. Because economic incentives exist for conducting commercial exchange, the market readjusts when sanctions are
unposed. After sanctions are imposed, nonsanctioning nations may supply
(or be supplied by) the target nation, and the sanctioning nation may
supply (or be supplied by) former customers (suppliers) of the nonsanctioning nations. For example, during the 1980 U.S. gram embargo against
the Soviet Union, the nations of Canada, Australia, Argentina, and the
European Community increased wheat sales to the Soviets; the United
States in turn shifted wheat sales to customers of these countries. The
Soviets were able to replace the wheat trade lost from the U.S. embargo by
purchasing from these other suppliers.
Such a market readjustment takes time, however, and raises the costs of
conducting trade and finance for the target nation by increasing its transportation costs, its expenses for developing new export markets (for
example, offering discount prices and liberal financing terms), and its
costs for raising capital (for example, increased interest payments).
Although the effects of trade sanctions dissipate over time, most of these
additional costs remain until the sanctions are lifted. For example, our
analysis of western import boycotts of South African products indicated
that in 1987, the first year after sanctions were imposed, the country lost
$266 million in exports; it recovered all except $44 million during 1988 by
redirecting trade to nonsanctioning nations. Yet, the previously mentioned
costs of market readjustment remained. Also, because South Africa’s
exports stagnated while world trade increased, its world market share of
products under sanction declined from a presanctions level (average of the
years 1984-1986) of 1.36 percent to 0.98 percent in 1987; it dropped even
Page 14 /-92-106 Economic Sanctions 
Chapter 3
The Economic Effects of Sanctions
further to 0.92 percent in 1988. In one particular commodity under
sanction-coal-South Africa was forced to sell at a discount on the world
market in an attempt to maintain its market share. The country also had to
pay a higher-than-market interest rate for what loans it could obtain.
Only in the rare case in which the nation imposing sanctions is also the one
dominant producer for an item can an effective unilateral export embargo
be imposed. For example, civilian aircraft in the free world are made with
at least some U.S.-built components. Sales to a target nation of such airplanes by U.S. and foreign aircraft manufacturers can be stopped by the
U.S. government through restrictions on the export and reexport of
products containing U.S. components and technology. In addition, spare
parts for machines built by the sanctioning nation and located in the target
state are sometimes vulnerable to a unilateral export embargo; the parts
are hard to obtain from sources other than the original supplier. According
to the then-President of Iran, the United States significantly hurt the Iranian economy in 1979 when it embargoed spare parts to retaliate for the
taking of hostages. The embargo induced shortages of spare parts and
raised the cost of acquiring the items illegally through intermediaries.
U.S.-built equipment was critical to operating the Iranian military and the
key oil and gas sectors; the embargo on spare parts impaired the activities
of these industries.
When nations that constitute a significant portion of world supply or
demand for the items under sanction impose the measures multilaterally,
actual permanent trade losses can occur. The target will not be able to
replace all exports, imports, or financial inflows lost because of sanctions
or will take many years to develop new markets to recoup the losses. After
the United Nations imposed a strong boycott in the mid- 1960s on Rhodesia
to pressure its government to adopt majority black rule, Rhodesian exports
declined. Exports were 278-million Rhodesian dollars in 1965; in 1966, the
first year of sanctions, they were 17 1 -million dollars. Exports did not
return to or exceed the 1965 level until 1972.
In the rare cases when sanctions become universal and are enforced by
physically preventing commerce-for example, by the 1990 U.N.-
sanctioned naval blockade against Iraq-trade losses can be severe. The
U.N. embargo was unique because it had an unprecedented degree of international participation and enforcement.
Even in such unique cases, a target can evade sanctions. There were
reports that prohibited goods were shipped to Iraq through neighboring
Page 15 /-92-106 Economic Sanctions 
Chapter 3
The Economic Effeete of Sanctions
countries. Because there are ample monetary incentives for illegal trade,
evasion is substantial in many episodes of sanctions. However, the need for
evasion increases the cost of trade and finance because intermediaries
must be paid significant fees to “launder” goods and financial transactions
to or from prohibited nations through third countries to disguise them.
Sanctions Have Indirect
costs
Indirect costs also result from sanctions. These costs, which include a
slowing of long-term growth and sanction-induced inefficiencies in the
target nation’s economy, can sometimes exceed the direct costs of lost
trade and capital. While the effects of trade sanctions dissipate over time,
the effects of financial measures multiply. When sanctions cause capital to
become more costly or scarce, future investment and long-term economic
growth will decline. In South Africa, foreign private and government
sanctions on lending and investment in 1985 and 1986 contributed to these
effects in the late 1980s. The formal and informal reluctance of foreign
nations to infuse new money into South Africa and the higher cost of such
capital that the country did obtain caused a chilling of confidence in the
financial markets. This chilling caused domestic South African investment
to decline, leading to lower rates of long-term economic growth. The
average real economic growth rate for South Africa was a sluggish
1.5 percent from 1985 to 1989.
Sanctions can also cause inefficiencies in the target economy when new
industries must be created to substitute for more expensive or scarce
imports. For example, the multilateral oil and arms embargoes against
South Africa caused that nation to make otherwise unlikely investments in
expensive and inefficient arms and synthetic fuel industries. Although
South Africa became more self-sufficient in the energy and military sectors,
that self-sufficiency came at a high price. Import-substitution industries
such as those are inefficient because the target nation could use its efforts a
to produce products more suited to the resource base it naturally possesses. This inefficient substitution lowers the rate of return on investment
for the target economy as a whole. When taxes are raised to pay for such
undertakings, normal investment patterns can be distorted by rendering
other usually feasible projects infeasible.
Sanctions can also increase the costs of trade and finance to the
sanctioning nation because it loses mutually beneficial commercial
transactions. The additional costs to the sanctioning nation may include
lost profits from prohibited exports to and financial transactions with the
Page 16 /-92-106 Economic Sanction6 
Chapter 3
The Economic Effects of Sanctions
target nation. Also, the sanctioning nation generally must pay higher prices
for imports from alternative suppliers.
Exporters in the sanctioning nation may complain that the use of
embargoes makes their country appear to be an unreliable supplier; this
perception can erode future sales. For example, farm organizations in the
United States made this claim in the wake of the U.S. grain embargo
against the Soviet Union.
Specific Effects of
Export, Import, and
Financial Sanctions
Sanctions can be imposed that prohibit importing items from the target
nation or that prohibit financial transactions with the target nation. These
import and financial sanctions, respectively, have separate and distinct
effects, although market forces tend to reinforce these effects. Sanctions
may also be imposed that prohibit exports to the target nation. The economic incentive to evade such export sanctions or embargoes tends to
undermine their effectiveness.
Market Forces Often
Reinforce Import and
Financial Sanctions
It is often easier for the sanctioning country to obtain international cooperation when imposing a ban on both imports from the target nation and the
flow of financial capital to the target nation than when it is imposing an
embargo on the export of goods to that nation. A ban on imports from a
lesser developed nation can be particularly effective because such nations
oftentimes export items that are in abundant supply on world markets-for
example, primary products, such as agricultural goods, and widely
produced manufactured items, such as textiles and iron and steel.
Developed nations, which often seek protection for these same industries,
are more likely to participate in boycotts on imports of these items because
they also reduce competition from the developing target nation. Their
cooperation often extends to enforcement, a common problem when sanc- a
tions are imposed.
Import boycotts against goods in excess supply also can benefit from the
reduced number of alternative markets available for the target nation to
redirect its exports. Therefore, the market forces of abundant supply often
reinforce the effects of import boycotts. For example, South Africa’s
exports of coal, textiles, uranium, and iron and steel were reduced in 1987
from 1986 pre-sanction levels by western import boycotts reinforced by
soft markets for these products.
Page 17 /-92-100 Economic Sanctions 
Chapter 3
The Economic Effects of Sanctions
Market forces also frequently strengthen the effects of financial sanctions.
When the sanctioning nation imposes bans on lending to or investment in
the target country, business confidence in that market is chilled. Private
capital from the sanctioning nation or public and private capital from other
nonsanctioning nations may cease to flow to the target or may be withdrawn when sanctions or the threat of them are used. A flood of companies
voluntarily removed their assets from South Africa in part because further
sanctions against that country were threatened. Many U.S. pension funds
and universities also divested their holdings in South African corporations.
Despite its illegality under South African law, South African capital was
also flowing out of the country because of a domestic loss of business confidence.
Banks are especially sensitive to the behavior of other international banks
when assessing the risks of doing business in a particular nation. When one
bank refuses to lend to a country because sanctions are threatened or
imposed, other banks often perceive increased risk and suspend or end
their lending. In 1985 French government and U.S. local government sanctions and threatened measures by the governments of the United States,
the European Community, and the Commonwealth of Nations (the United
Kingdom and its former colonies) played a role in Chase Manhattan Bank’s
refusal to loan new money or extend the repayment period for South
Africa’s credits that were coming due. Other international banks followed
suit, causing a major financial crisis in South Africa. Because South Africa
was getting no new money from banks and funds were flowing out of the
country from disinvestment by foreign corporations and the illegal flight of
South African capital, the country had a shortage of capital. Similarly, private western banks might have been less willing to make loans after
multilateral lenders, such as the World Bank and the Asian Development
Bank, suspended new loans to the People’s Republic of China in 1989.
When such multilateral lenders suspend lending, it sends a strong signal to a
the international financial community.
Market Forces Often
Undermine Export
Embargoes
In contrast, market forces frequently work to undermine embargoes on
exports to target nations. Abundant supply in many world markets, and the
accompanying strong competition for sales, gives exporting companies in
the sanctioning nation an incentive to evade any embargo and to sell into
the prohibited market by “laundering” the goods through third countries.
If these exporters do not act, given the excess supply in the market, the
target often can easily get products from competing companies in
nonsanctioning nations. For example, the Soviet Union was able to replace
Page 18 /TWIAD-92-106 Economic Sanctions 
Chapter 3
The Economic Effects of Sanctions
U.S. wheat sales after the 1980 grain embargo by purchasing from other
grain-exporting nations. Export embargoes also may cause nontarget
nations to switch suppliers because they perceive companies in the
sanctioning nation to be unreliable suppliers.
Also, sanctioning governments can fail to honor their commitments to
enforce sanctions. These governments can gain political advantage from
cooperating in international efforts to punish the unacceptable behavior of
a target nation; at the same time, they reap economic benefits by looking
the other way as their companies evade the sanctions and illicitly take over
the market share of other sanctioning countries. For example, although all
of the major oil-producing nations imposed a ban on exports of crude oil to
South Africa in the 197Os, that country continues to obtain all of the petroleum it needs through independent oil traders acting as intermediaries.
Export, Import, and When used together, export, import, and financial sanctions can reinforce
Financial Sanctions Reinforce each other. Although embargoes on exports to the target nation are particEach Other ularly prone to evasion, they raise the cost of imports to that country.
When sanctions are also imposed on financial flows to the target country
and on imports of the country’s revenue-earning exports, they will reduce
the funds available for the target that could be used to pay the higher
prices for its imports. For example, a comprehensive, international
embargo on exports to Iraq in 1990 raised prices for the country’s imports.
Iraq’s funds that could be used to pay the higher prices were severely
eroded by a U.N. boycott of its exports (including the oil that accounts for
95 percent of its incoming revenues) and a freeze on new credit and its
overseas assets.
Sanctions Are Not a Precise Although export, import, and financial sanctions have unique effects, the a
Tool ability to use sanctions as a precision instrument to pressure certain population groups in the target nation while exempting others is very limited.
Sanctions are a blunt instrument and have many collateral adverse effects.
Sanctions imposed on one sector of an integrated economy will spill over
into other sectors. Furthermore, the target government can take measures
to help redirect the costs of sanctions from groups that support it to
groups that oppose it or are politically weak. For example, U.S. financial
sanctions against Panama in 1988 were designed to reduce funds available
to General Noriega’s government and defense forces without harming the
Panamanian economy. By avoiding infrastructure improvement and repairs
and thus reducing investment by 79 percent, however, the Noriega
Page 19 /-92-106 Economic Sanctions 
Chapter 3
The Economic Effecte of Sanctions
government was able to redirect the costs of sanctions to the general
economy. As a result, it could continue to pay the salaries of the defense
forces and government workers and thus prevent these key groups from
defecting to the opposition.

Chapter 4
Factors Affecting the Success of Sanctions
The historical record of economic sanctions provides some insight into the
factors that affect their success. It does not provide any rules or an ability
to predict whether any future sanctions will be successful. Several lessons
do emerge, however, that point to important issues that would be relevant
in evaluating any use of sanctions.
One key lesson is that the likelihood of successfully attaining the foreign
policy goals of an economic sanction is usually not determined by the
actual economic damage caused by the measures. When the target government faces significant domestic political opposition, imposing selected,
moderate sanctions with the threat of more to come is likely to have a
greater effect than imposing comprehensive, severe measures that rally the
population in the target country around its government. Severe measures
can also push target nations closer to countries that are enemies of the
sanctioning nation.
Other important lessons concern the nature of the sanctions and the
relationship between the sanctioning and target nation, as well as
conditions in the target nation. Sanctions are usually more effective when
imposed multilaterally or against friendly nations. Cultural characteristics
in the target nation may make the country more susceptible or more resistant to sanctions. In addition, the amount of international publicity sanctions receive can positively or negatively affect their success depending on
how extensive the measures are and what goal they are attempting to
achieve.
Table 4.1 summarizes these lessons, indicating the factors contributing to
or reducing the chances for sanctions to be successful. These factors are
explored in more detail in this chapter.

Noneconomic factors are often more important in determining whether
sanctions are effective than is the economic damage caused by them. This
fact is important because domestic commercial interests in the sanctioning
nation often oppose imposing sanctions, requiring policymakers to impose
One important noneconomic factor is the strength of political opposition in
the target nation, When the target government faces significant internal
Page 22 /-92-106 Economic Sanctions 
Chapter 4
Fuctors Affecting the Success of Sanctions
opposition, economic sanctions can cause powerful interests, particularly
those target country nationals with international commercial ties, to lobby
the government to comply with the sanctioning nation’s demands (the
“fifth column effect”). Selected, moderate sanctions, with the threat of
more severe measures to come, inflict some economic pain on influential
interests, giving them an incentive to lobby for compliance to alleviate the
more severe impending threat. The political benefits derived from
imposing graduated sanctions override the disadvantage of allowing the
target nation time to adjust its economy.
The potential economic damage from threatened future sanctions has more
effect on the chances for a politically successful outcome than the actual
damage from measures imposed. When harsh, comprehensive sanctions
are imposed immediately, business interests have no incentive to lobby the
target government for changes in policy to avoid threatened future measures. After comprehensive sanctions are imposed, few stronger economic
measures can be taken, removing the leverage of this threat. Furthermore,
commercial interests have a greater incentive to cooperate with their
government for mere survival (the “rally around the flag effect”-if
stringent measures are imposed. This effect can be mitigated with the use
of selected, moderate sanctions; that is, both the “rally around the flag”
and the “fifth column effects” can occur simultaneously, but the “fifth
column effect” will predominate.
Continuing partial sanctions against South Africa with the threat of more to
come simultaneously contributed to rallying around the flag by conservative South African whites and to increased pressure on the South African
government to end apartheid not only by blacks, but also by more liberal
white South African business interests, as well. Such pressure predominated over the “rally around the flag effect” and contributed to the government’s willingness to release black opposition leaders from jail, to allow 4
the black opposition to operate more freely, to announce the elimination of
laws that were part of the foundation of the apartheid system, and to begin
negotiations on a new constitution.
Financial sanctions imposed on Panama in 1988 to harm the Noriega
government but not the Panamanian economy also generated both effects.
Some groups in Panama supported U.S. sanctions, and others rallied
around the government. President Delvalle, deposed by General Noriega
and supported in exile by the United States, opposed stronger sanctions
because of fears that a widespread backlash would occur among the
Panamanian people and overwhelm the fifth column effect.
Page 23 /-92-106 Economic Sanctions 
Chapter 4
Factora Affecting the Success of Sanctions
Therefore, when political opposition exists, the threat of further sanctions
is often more potent politically than the immediate imposition of
comprehensive measures. When no significant political opposition exists
and the fifth column effect is therefore absent, the target government can
use an external government’s harsh, comprehensive sanctions as a means
to rally the population around its policies. For example, according to several analysts, the complete ban on U.S. trade and financial transactions
with Cuba from the 1960s to the present allowed the Castro government to
use the external threat posed by the United States to win additional popular
support. In addition, as a visible symbol of U.S. hostility, the sanctions
made it possible for Castro to justify building a large military and establishing tight political controls on Cuban society.
Severe comprehensive sanctions can also drive the target nation closer to
countries that are adversaries of the sanctioning country. Even if it would
not otherwise do so, a target nation might become more friendly with such
adversaries because of the severity of the economic pain caused by comprehensive measures. These nations may replace trade and assistance lost
from the sanctioning nation,
The clearest examples of the counterproductive effect of fostering ties
between a target nation and adversaries of the sanctioning nation stem
from the Cold War rivalry of the United States and the Soviet Union. Some
analysts feel that U.S. attempts to isolate Cuba, including the imposition of
comprehensive sanctions, encouraged its closer relations with communist
nations. After the United States began cutting quotas on imports of Cuban
sugar in mid-l 960, Cuba negotiated a series of new trade agreements with
communist nations. In only 2 years, Cuba redirected most of its trade from
the United States to these nations. Before 1960, Cuba conducted
65-75 percent of its trade with the United States, but in 1961, the first full
year after the United States imposed sanctions, Cuba was sending 75 per- 4
cent of its exports to the communist bloc and receiving 86 percent of its
imports from these nations. The Soviets also began providing large
amounts of technical and monetary aid to the Castro government.
Communist nations also provided substantial trade and assistance to the
Sandinista government in Nicaragua to compensate for U.S. sanctions,
which were imposed in 1985 and designed to pressure the Sandinista government to reduce military spending, make democratic reforms, and end
its support for leftist insurgencies in Central America. The Soviet Union
replaced the United States as a supplier of fertilizer, machinery, motor
vehicles, and other capital goods.

Fe&ore Affecting the Success of Sanctions
While this potential counterproductive effect of sanctions is most evident
in examples rooted in the Cold War, the end of that conflict does not mean
that the potential for any future sanctions to induce closer relations
between a target and an adversary can be dismissed. Regional conflicts, for
instance, may continue.
Multilateral Sanctions
Are More Effective
Sanctions do not have to be multilateral to have positive political effects,
though this feature helps. Unilateral sanctions can contribute to the
achievement of primary goals, as well as to more modest secondary and
tertiary objectives. By imposing import sanctions on the Soviet Union in
1933, the British government achieved the primary goal of obtaining the
release of its citizens held by that country. In 1989, India imposed unilateral trade sanctions against Nepal, a traditional buffer against its adversary
China, because of the Nepalese government’s tilt toward that country.
Those sanctions made some contribution to political reform in Nepal, the
naming of a prime minister committed to improving relations with India,
and the suspension of a Nepalese arms purchase from China.
Multilateral sanctions can usually impose greater economic pressure on the
target than unilateral measures. Yet, obtaining international cooperation
for sanctions may enhance their political effectiveness through noneconomic mechanisms rather than by inflicting overwhelming economic
damage on the target. As more nations impose selected sanctions, the psychological threat of future measures and the potential economic damage
caused by them are made more credible.
Multilateral measures also increase the chances for political success by
showing that more than just one nation is concerned about the target’s
behavior, thereby enhancing the political legitimacy of the effort. International ostracism can have a substantial psychological effect on the target 4
population. For example, 3 decades of multilateral sanctions against South
Africa, isolating the country in the world community, led to sanctionsinduced fatigue. The measures also helped indirectly by showing whites
that the western community viewed apartheid as immoral.
Failure of an attempt to get multilateral cooperation, however, can cause
sanctions to be counterproductive. Disputes among allied nations over
sanctions that are designed to transmit a signal of resolve to the target may
convey the opposite signal of weakness and disarray. Allied nations often
have divergent economic interests and disagree about whether and what to
sanction. For example, after the 1981 imposition of martial law in Poland,
Page 25 /-92-106 Economic Sanctions 
Chapter 4
Factors Affecting the Success of Sanctions
a dispute arose in the western alliance over whether to embargo exports of
equipment to the Soviet Union to be used in constructing a natural gas
pipeline from that nation to Western Europe, The United States wanted to
prohibit the exports to punish the Soviet Union for what it believed was the
orchestration of Polish martial law and to delay the building of a pipeline
that would generate hard currency revenues for the Soviet Union and
increase Western Europe’s dependence on Soviet energy. The U.S. government ordered European subsidiaries of American companies and European
firms that had contractual agreements to use U.S. technology to refrain
from selling equipment containing such technology to the Soviet Union for
use in building the pipeline. In defiance of U.S. wishes, the governments of
France, Britain, and Italy, on whose territory these companies were
located, ordered the firms to sell the equipment to the Soviet Union. The
dispute caused considerable disagreement in the western alliance. Instead
of sending a unified alliance signal to the Soviet Union that Polish martial
law was unacceptable to the West, the alliance appeared divided and indecisive .
A similar episode occurred in 1935, when the League of Nations, led by
France and Britain, imposed comprehensive import and selected export
and financial sanctions on fascist Italy for its invasion of Ethiopia. A dispute arose between the United Kingdom, which wanted somewhat stronger
measures, and France, which wanted milder measures because of its
stronger need to cultivate Mussolini as an ally against Adolf Hitler’s Germany. The resulting measures, which omitted key items such as oil, coal,
and steel from the embargo, sent the opposite signal from what had
intended. According to Albert Speer, a former high-level Nazi official,
Hitler interpreted the dispute as showing that the United Kingdom and
France were too irresolute to stop his further territorial ambitions. In addition, neighbors of Italy-the nations of Austria, Albania, and
Hungary-declined to participate in sanctions, creating a large gap in 4
enforcement.
Sanctions on Friendly A friendly target nation, defined by having substantial economic and politNations Have Greater ical ties to the sanctioning country before sanctions are initiated, will have
greater incentives to comply with that country’s wishes after the measures
Potential for are imposed. Potential costs to the target for noncompliance are greater
Effectiveness when the sanctioning nation is friendly than when it is adversarial. For
example, western sanctions against South Africa played a role in inducing
the government to reform the apartheid system, in part because South
Africa was politically and commercially tied to the West. The country
Page 26 /-92-106 Economic Sanctions 
Chapter 4
Factors Affecting the Success of Sanctions
conducted about 80 percent of its trade with six industrialized western
nations and obtained virtually all its foreign capital from the West.
Despite the increased likelihood of a successful outcome for sanctions
against friendly nations, they may be less likely to be imposed. The key
ingredient of success-close presanction political and economic ties-will
increase the costs for the sanctioning nation to impose the measures.
Cultural Factors in the When the target society has cultural ties to the sanctioning nation or
Target Nation nations, the fifth column effect is more likely to predominate. Elements of
the target society are more inclined to identify with the goals of the sanctioning nation. For example, South African whites consider themselves to
be part of the western community. One of the reasons sanctions contributed to political reform is that the white community felt isolated and morally ostracized by the western world. Sanctions encouraged more liberal
whites to pressure the South African government for reform. Where few
cultural affinities exist between the two nations, the target government will
find it easier to generate a rally around the flag effect among its people.
Other cultural factors in the target society also may undermine the
effectiveness of sanctions. In societies with strong shame and honor
codes-that is, countries where “face-saving” is paramount-it may be difficult for the target government to comply with the sanctioning nation’s
wishes without appearing weak. This shame and honor code was cited by
some analysts as a reason for Saddam Hussein’s refusal to withdraw Iraqi
military forces from Kuwait after his invasion in 1990, even in the face of
extensive economic damage caused by the most universally adopted, comprehensive sanctions in history.

Publicity Surrounding Whether conspicuous, public sanctions or behind-the-scenes measures
Sanctions between governments are more likely to be politically effective depends on
the goal to be achieved. If the goal is to make the target comply with the
wishes of the sanctioning nation, publicized sanctions can be counterproductive especially when harsh, comprehensive measures are employed or
the target society has a strong shame and honor code. Publicity for sanctions can magnify a target government’s need to take a defiant stance to
avoid appearing weak to its people. Furthermore, the publicity
surrounding sanctions may allow the target government to consolidate support by means of the rally around the flag effect when it is weak politically
or when it needs to avoid blame for its own economic mismanagement. As
Page 2 7 /-92-106 Economic Sanctions 
Chapter 4
Factors Affecting the Success of Sanctions
noted earlier, Fidel Castro used US. sanctions in the early 1960s to
strengthen the domestic standing of his new government by depicting an
aggressive external enemy. Castro also blamed the country’s economic
problems on the sanctions.
Under certain circumstances, however, international publicity for sanctions
can contribute to target compliance with the sanctioning nation’s wishes.
International public ostracism by use of sanctions can sometimes enhance
the fifth column effect. The previously mentioned rally around the flag
effect generated by publicity when using comprehensive sanctions can be
mitigated by using selected, moderate measures with the public threat of
more. The episode of sanctions against South Africa shows that publicity
can enhance international ostracism and isolation of the target and make
the threat of future measures more credible.
International publicity is vital when the goal of sanctions is to punish the
target for violating international norms, deter the target or other nations
from displaying future unacceptable behavior, or show support for the
political opposition in the target. U.S. restrictions on new credits, high
technology exports, preferential trade status, and International Monetary
Fund membership for Poland imposed in 1981-l 982 to punish that nation
for imposing martial law and suppressing the Solidarity trade union
benefited from publicity in conveying its message. Publicity for trade and
financial sanctions against Libya in the 1980s was helpful to symbolically
express U.S. displeasure for that nation’s terrorist activities and interventions into the affairs of neighboring states. Publicity was also vital for the
1980 U.S. export embargo on grain and high technology to deter further
aggression by the Soviet Union after its invasion of Afghanistan. In addition
to pressuring the regime to end apartheid, public western sanctions against
South Africa sent a signal of support to the black opposition. Some analysts
believe this signal provided internal impetus for reform by adding interna- 4
tional support for the black opposition’s cause and encouraging it to take
stronger positions against the South African government. This action may
have been the most important effect of international sanctions against
South Africa.
